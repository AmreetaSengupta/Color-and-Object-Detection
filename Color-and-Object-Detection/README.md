# Color-and-Object-Detection
Contains the code for Moving Object Detection and Following Robot using Raspberry Pi on Linux

The code involves:
--> Development of algorithm for color and shape detection of the ball using OpenCV.

--> Development of an algorithm for object detection and control of motor using PWM to drive the motor.

--> Design of a scheduler to meet the real time deadlines for the threads performing the tasks above using Embedded Linux as Real
    Time Operating System
